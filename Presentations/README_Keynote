Keynote 3.0.1 blows away .svn directories when saving a
presentation. As a workaround, save the svn state before editing:

 find *.key -type d -name .svn | xargs tar cvf svn_state.tar

Before checkin, restore the state:

 tar xvf svn_state.tar

And then use 'svn st' and 'svn add' to add any new files in your presentation.
